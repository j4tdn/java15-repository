                <h2 class="quotes">What is sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile with being a sports car.</h2>
                <p>A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile
                    designed for spirited
                    performance and nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The Times, London in 1919.
                    According
                    to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known use of the term was in 1928. Sports cars
                    started
                    to become popular during the 1920s.
                </p>
                <p> Sports cars may be spartan or luxurious, but high maneuverability and light weight are requisite.
                    Sports
                    cars are usually aerodynamically shaped (since the 1950s), and have a low center of gravity compared
                    to
                    standard models. Steering and suspension are typically designed for precise control at high speeds.
                    Traditionally sports cars were open roadsters, but closed coup√©s also started to become popular
                    during
                    the 1930s, and the distinction between a sports car and a grand tourer is not absolute.

                <h1 class="title">Seating Layout</h1>
                <h2 class="quotes">Traditional sports cars were typically two-soat roadsters.</h2>
                <p>Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting
                    regulations often
                    demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often produced by coachbuilders), two seats became
                    common
                    from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may also have small back seats that are often really
                    only
                    suitable for luggage or small children; such a configuration is referred to as a 2+2 (two full seats
                    +
                    two "occasional" seats).
                    <br><br><br>
                    Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the practicality of their
                    vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place the driver's seat in the center of
                    the
                    car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats on each side and slightly behind the driver. The
                    arrangement was originally considered for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical
                    because of
                    the difficulty for the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used the design in their F1.
